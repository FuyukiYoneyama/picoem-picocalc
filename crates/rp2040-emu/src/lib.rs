//! RP2040 emulator library.
//!
//! Phase 5.A fills in the bus fabric, CLOCKS/RESETS/PLL/XOSC/ROSC
//! register storage, full SIO (GPIO, CPUID, FIFO, spinlocks, divider,
//! interpolators — **no** doorbells / MTIME / coprocessor bridge),
//! IO_BANK0 / PADS_BANK0, XIP_CTRL / SSI stubs, and dual-core stepping
//! (core 0 runs; core 1 stays halted until woken via the SIO FIFO
//! protocol).
//!
//! Phase 5.B wires the two PIO blocks (`bus.pio[0]`, `bus.pio[1]`) into
//! AHB at `0x5020_0000` / `0x5030_0000`, steps them once per emulator
//! step, and merges their pad outputs into `bus.gpio_in` (PIO OE
//! overrides SIO on a per-pin basis, mirroring `rp2350_emu::Emulator`).
