//! `CoreBus` trait — the bus-facing surface that `CortexM0Plus::step`
//! and its helpers use to talk to the bus fabric. Dual-execution HLD V1
//! Stage 3b.1.
//!
//! Modelled after `rp2350_emu::core::bus_trait::CoreBus`, trimmed to the
//! ARMv6-M + RP2040 fabric shape:
//!
//! - Narrow memory access: `read{8,16,32}` / `write{8,16,32}` take
//!   **no** `core` argument. The RP2040 bus tracks the currently
//!   executing core via `Bus::set_active_core` / `Bus::active_core`
//!   instead of threading the identifier through every access. This
//!   matches the existing `Bus` inherent-method shape exactly, so
//!   monomorphized call-site codegen is unchanged.
//! - Single bus-fault slot: `bus_fault` takes no core argument — M0+
//!   has one synchronous-fault path and RP2040 uses a single sticky
//!   flag across both cores.
//! - `set_active_pc` — one PC per active core, stored in
//!   `Bus::active_pc[active_core]`. Matches the existing inherent
//!   method.
//! - Per-core PPB and NVIC accessors (`ppb_mut`, `nvic_mut`) — both
//!   live on `Bus` as two-element arrays today. Stage 3b.2 will add a
//!   `WorkerBus` impl that returns shared-state references with the
//!   same signature.
//! - GPIO and clock-tree / MMIO-trace accessors stay on the inherent
//!   `Bus` methods for now — Stage 3b.1 scope is only the step hot
//!   path, not the periphery. The trait can be extended in later
//!   sub-stages without breaking this one.
//!
//! Dropped vs RP2350's trait: FPU, secure world, `CoreAtomics`
//! namespace ptr-eq trip-wire, `set_burst_mode`, `add_extra_wait_states`
//! / `take_extra_wait_states`, `last_fetch_addr`, `emit_mmio_trace`.
//! None of these exist on M0+ / the RP2040 bus today. If later stages
//! need them (e.g. a per-core exclusive-monitor model on the threaded
//! path), they can be added then.
