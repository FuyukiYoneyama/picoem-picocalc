Placeholder crate for the future GDB RSP server, instruction trace, and
DWT-driven tooling in the [picoem](https://github.com/FuyukiYoneyama/picoem-picocalc)
RP2350 / RP2354 / RP2040 emulator workspace.

**This crate currently has no public API.** It is reserved on crates.io
for the project's GDB / debug tooling, which is slated for a later phase
of the workspace HLD roadmap. Until then it builds successfully but
exposes nothing useful.

If you want to embed a Pico emulator in your project today, depend on
[`rp2350-emu`](https://crates.io/crates/rp2350-emu) or
[`rp2040-emu`](https://crates.io/crates/rp2040-emu) directly.
